{"license":"","file_hash":null,"name":"bimorphNodes","version":"1.5.25","description":"BimorphNodes are a collection of powerful utility nodes for Dynamo and Revit.\r\n\r\nThis is the first package in Dynamo for Revit capable of converting curves from CAD links or imports using Layer Names as filters. Output curves are organised into sublists according to their layers.\r\n\r\nThe CurveFromCADLayers node is also optimised to convert more curve types than is currently possible with Explode in Revit or Revit.Elements.Element.Curves in Dynamo. There is also the option to create Revit Model Lines from the curves without introducing unwanted CAD LineStyles into the project.\r\n\r\nThe package also includes:\r\n- Nodes for querying CAD link or import layers\r\n\r\n- Nodes to duplicate Sheets and placed Views\r\n\r\n- Nodes to renumber and rename Sheets\r\n\r\n- Nodes for extracting table data from Schedules\r\n\r\n- Nodes for creating and querying LineStyles\r\n\r\nCompatible with Revit 2015+ and Dynamo v1.0+.
